# WaveformVisualizer

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.1.

## Setup

Run `npm install` to setup the project and its dependencies.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Currently the tests will fail. I didn't have the time to do it.

## Known issues:
1. Comments listing is not ready, didn't have enough time.
2. Time indicator and comments popup will not hide sometimes.
3. There are unit tests for CallsService and VisualizerComponent.
